        <h1>Common Recycling Myths</h1>
        <h2>While it's good to recycle objects, there are also many myths that people are unaware of. According to the University of Colorado, Boulder's Enviornmental Center, here are some of the more commmon myths:</h2>
            <h3>1. A Product labeled "eco-friendly" means it is enviornmentally friendly</h3>
            <p>Sometimes, major corporations advertise their product with misleading information, and claim that the product is good for the enviornment when it is not. (A process called "Greenwashing") One of the most commonly mistaken items is plastic water bottles. For plastic water bottles as well as items with  a "95% biodegradable" tag, be wary, and check the item carefully.</p>
            <h4>2. The Recyclable symbol means a product is recyclable</h4>
            <p>A common myth is that the number inside the recycle symbol on plastic items is an indicator that a product is recyclable, but actually it’s a resin identification code that tells what type of plastic the item is made of. In order to see if the item is truly recyclable, check with your local recycling center to see if it is an acceptable type of plastic in your area. Don’t automatically assume all plastic is recyclable, another common myth!</p>
            <h5>3. All Recycling ends up in the landfill</h5>
            <p>Not true! Oftentimes recycled material is sold in strong domestic markets. Some items are high in monetary value such as aluminum, cardboard, and office paper while other items aren't. However even then it can also be turned into new products to reuse again in the future!</p>
